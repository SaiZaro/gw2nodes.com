                <dt>I'm missing feature Z!</dt>
                <dd>Send me a mail in-game: <em>koenvu.7584</em>. <strong><em>Mail only please, no whispers.</em></strong> I consider all feature requests, but might not implement them all.</dd>
                
                <dt>How do I add a node?</dt>
                <dd>First, make sure you are viewing the map for the correct server. Then, right-click on the location of the map where you want to add a node.</dd>

                <dt>Why don't I see nodes?</dt>
                <dd>The maps might have been reset recently. Or you mistyped the server IP. Or no one has bothered to add nodes for the map you are viewing; node locations are submitted by users.</dd>

                <dt>Why am I seeing Google Ads?</dt>
                <dd>I need to pay for hosting and a domain name. The ads are an attempt to cover these costs. Sorry.</dd>

                <dt>Why is it showing icon X?</dt>
                <dd>A node on the map shows the icon of the most profitable item that you can normally gather from that particular node.</dd>

                <dt>I'm missing node type Y!</dt>
                <dd>Send me a mail in-game for suggested node types: <em>koenvu.7584</em>. <strong><em>Mail only please, no whispers.</em></strong></dd>
